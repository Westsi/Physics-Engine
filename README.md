## REQUIRES Westsi/CommandLineTools to be installed and added to path for compilation purposes - this is not necessary for running executables

## TODO

- [x] Test Coordinate System
- [ ] Make particle module obsolete, replaced with sphere
  - [ ] As part of above, adapt all the particle methods to work with all shapes
- [ ] Implement collision
- [ ] Improve readme

And down the line...
- [ ] Make demos
- [ ] Make alpha version
